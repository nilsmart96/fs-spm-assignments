In this case, the null hypothesis would be that there is no relationship between RiskScore and GrossDrugCost.

    "The coefficient for the RiskScore variable is 1.11. It indicates that, on average, for every one-unit increase in RiskScore, we can expect an estimated increase of 1.11 in GrossDrugCost. This means that as the RiskScore of patients increases, their drug costs tend to increase as well.\n",

    "The T-statistic of 49.57 indicates the significance of the RiskScore variable in explaining variations in GrossDrugCost. A larger T-statistic, relative to its standard error, suggests that the relationship between RiskScore and GrossDrugCost is statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The P-value of the RiskScore is 0. It represents the probability that the relationship between RiskScore and GrossDrugCost is purely due to random chance. A small P-value (< 0.05) suggests that the relationship is statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the RiskScore variable appears to be a statistically significant predictor of GrossDrugCost. As RiskScore increases, we can expect a corresponding increase in drug costs, and this relationship is not likely to be due to random chance.

    "Coefficient: The coefficient for the intercept represents the estimated value of the dependent variable (GrossDrugCost) when all independent variables (in this case, RiskScore) are set to zero.

However, it serves as the estimated starting point for GrossDrugCost when all other factors are absent or negligible.\n",

    "P-value: The P-value associated with the intercept represents the probability of observing the T-statistic (or a more extreme value) if the null hypothesis were true.

    "### Practical Explanation to Senior Management:\n",
    "\n",
    "The intercept in our regression model represents the estimated starting point for GrossDrugCost when the RiskScore is set to zero. However, in reality, it might not make practical sense for RiskScore to be zero, so the intercept should be interpreted with caution. It essentially gives us a baseline estimate of GrossDrugCost in the absence of any risk factors or predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard error associated with the intercept tells us how much uncertainty there is in this baseline estimate. A smaller standard error means that our estimate is more precise and reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The T-statistic for the intercept helps us assess whether the baseline estimate is statistically different from zero. In our analysis, a higher T-statistic suggests that the intercept is more likely to be different from zero, indicating that there is a significant starting point for GrossDrugCost even without considering the risk score.\n",
    "\n",
    "The P-value associated with the intercept tells us the probability of observing such an intercept value by random chance if there were no actual intercept effect. A low P-value indicates that the intercept is statistically significant, which means that it is highly likely that there is a meaningful starting point for GrossDrugCost.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the intercept provides us with a baseline estimate of GrossDrugCost when all other factors are negligible, and our analysis suggests that this baseline estimate is statistically significant. This information is important for understanding the fundamental starting point for drug costs, which can be useful for various business decisions and resource allocation in healthcare management.\n",

    "Adjusted R-Squared is 0.075, which is close to 0. It suggests that the independent variables in the model are not effective in explaining the variance in the dependent variable. This may indicate that the model is a poor fit for the data, and the independent variable(s) may not be good predictors. We would advice the management to use more variables to determine GrossDrugCost."
